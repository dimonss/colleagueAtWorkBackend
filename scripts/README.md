## Mock Data Structure

Each employee contains:
- **Name**: Realistic Russian names
- **Position**: Various IT and business roles
- **Department**: 8 different departments
- **Email**: Corporate email addresses
- **Phone**: Russian phone numbers
- **Hire Date**: Various dates over the last 3 years
- **Salary**: Realistic salaries (75k - 140k)

## Security

- Scripts request confirmation before deleting data
- Use the `--force` flag for automatic execution
- Scripts work only with the `colleagues` table (don't affect users)
- All operations are logged to console

## Integration with Tests

Scripts can be used to prepare test data:

```bash
# Prepare data for testing
npm run clear:force
npm run seed

# Run tests
npm test
```
